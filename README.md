## üèÜ A Work Day Scheduler üèÜ
Third-Party-APIs with HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

## üí°Background
For this assignment, the goal is to create a work day scheduler to display skills that are learned throughout the UConn Coding Bootcamp up until this time. This challenge enforces the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Third-Party APIs methods. The most important aspect of building this scheduler application is to showcase and share your skills with those within the computer science community. 

## üí° Description

* The purpose of this assignment is to bring one's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Third-Party APIs skills to the test! This requires advanced JavaScript knowledge, and it summarizes the most important aspects of what has been learned.

* Utilizied concepts to complete this assignment included knowledge and learning regarding HTML, CSS and specific focus on JavaScript, jQuery and Third-Party APIs. 

* The initial webpage introduces the user to the work day scheduler. The user will be able to record their plans by the hour by saving it to the scheduler. The work day scheduler will decipher the past, present and future by a color scheme of white, red and green. This work day scheduler will benefit users by organizing their work day efficiently and quick, easy access.
